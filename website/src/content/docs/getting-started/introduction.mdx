**noto-pdf-ts** is a lightweight PDF to image conversion library for Node.js.

## Features

```bash
# If canvas isn't installed automatically
npm install canvas
```

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { openPdf } from 'noto-pdf-ts';
import fs from 'node:fs/promises';

// Open a PDF file
const pdf = await openPdf('/path/to/document.pdf');

// Render all pages
for await (const page of pdf.renderPages()) {
  await fs.writeFile(`page-${page.pageNumber}.jpg`, page.buffer);
}

// Don't forget to close
await pdf.close();
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or later
- Native canvas support (provided by the `canvas` package)
